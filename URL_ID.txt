Understanding the data: We’ll analyze the data to identify the relevant variables and constraints. These may include the locations of installations, the duration of installations, the availability of team members, and customer preferences.
Defining the objective and constraints: The objective will be to minimize the total travel time or maximize the number of installations completed within a given time frame. The constraints will include the geographical distances between locations, the working hours of team members, and the specific requirements of each installation.
Implementing the algorithm: We’ll use an optimization algorithm, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver, to find the optimal routes. The algorithm will consider all possible routes and choose the one that best meets the objectives while adhering to the constraints.
Running simulations: To ensure the feasibility of the model, we’ll run simulations using different scenarios and adjust the parameters as needed.
Saving the output: The final output will be the suggested schedules, which can then be reviewed and approved by the relevant parties.
, 
One of the main challenges we anticipated is dealing with the complexity and variability of the data. The locations of installations, the duration of installations, the availability of team members, and customer preferences all need to be taken into account, and these factors can vary widely. Additionally, the model needs to be flexible enough to adapt to changes in the criteria as customers approve or reject appointment times.
, 
To overcome these challenges, we used advanced data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from the data. We’ll also develop a flexible model that can handle changes in the criteria. Furthermore, we’ll thoroughly test the model under different scenarios to ensure its robustness and reliability.

Product has many features but there was one feature which Is a “product type” that needs to be handled differently because it was important to have the product in a cluster must have the same product type. 
Some cases can’t be solved with machine learning algorithms.
, 
Handling Product Type as a Differentiating Feature: One of the challenges faced was dealing with the “product type” feature, which required special consideration. It was crucial to ensure that products with the same type were grouped together in the clustering or recommendation algorithm. This required developing a specific approach to address the uniqueness of the product type feature and incorporate it effectively into the recommendation system. Custom modifications and additional preprocessing steps were likely needed to accommodate this requirement and ensure accurate clustering based on product type.
Limitations of Machine Learning Algorithms: While machine learning algorithms are powerful tools for recommendation systems, there are cases where they may not be sufficient to solve certain challenges. During the project, it was likely discovered that some complex scenarios couldn’t be adequately addressed using traditional machine learning algorithms alone. To overcome this, alternative techniques and approaches beyond the scope of standard algorithms needed to be explored. This might involve incorporating domain-specific rules, utilizing other data analysis methods, or considering hybrid models that combine machine learning with expert knowledge to overcome the limitations and improve the recommendation system’s performance.

This information is utilised to make key business choices. Businesses should invest in data management systems that increase visibility, dependability, security, and scalability to ensure that workers have the required data for decision-making. The client wanted to get the data management process automated using a tool from Python. Multiple operations like merging,sorting, filtering had to be performed on data from various resources. The data resources were mainly csv files and data from SQL queries in PostgreSQL. , The project solution contained two tools that would aid in automatic efficient data storage. The first tool will concatenate all of the CSV files before merging them with the data from the SQL file. The acquired Excel file will be used as input for the second tool. The second tool will sort, filter, and lookup the Excel file received in the first tool. This tool will add columns that will be useful for the client’s analysis. The major goal is to assist the client with data management while requiring as little manual labour as possible. The files obtain the needed data in an Excel file by giving the proper input files., The project deliverables can be divided into two parts:, Two types of databases were used: Google excel sheets and PostgreSQL., Some minor challenges were faced such as data discrepancies generated during the automation process.  , The challenges were solved by reworking on the automation tool and consulting with the clients for their requirements. , It is critical to use appropriate data management procedures to ensure the smooth running of a firm. Furthermore, data management must be very precise, cost-effective, and completed as soon as possible. The inability to handle data can result in costly consequences and a permanent stain on the company’s image. Every company is responsible for developing a robust data management plan. The following are some of the reasons why data management is critical to the success of the firm. Instant Availability of Information: Data management makes information easily available for quick access based on company needs. Data management is also essential for accounting procedures like auditing and other strategy-based operations like company planning. The more time you spend hunting for misplaced files and missing documents, the less productive you will be. And you are aware that time is money. Keeping all of your documents structured might therefore assist to make procedures run more smoothly and quickly. Compliance: The government passed legislation requiring businesses to maintain these data. There are also periodical checks to verify that there is no manipulation. Furthermore, if a corporation is involved in a dispute, they must maintain these records for years until a solid verdict on the matter is reached. Faster Transitions to New Technology: Because technology trends change so quickly, organizations must embrace whatever comes their way. Losing information due to obsolete or outdated systems is the last thing you want for your company. Every piece of data preserved in the firm records is essential for everyday operations, managing multiple divisions, completing computations, audits, and so on. Make Right Business Decisions: Businesses use a variety of information sources for company planning, trend research, and performance management. To execute the same activity, different departments’ teams employ different sources of information. Because the legitimacy and precision of information are highly dependent on the source, analyzing several sources may have a detrimental influence on the organization. Robust data management prevents this from happening., , Fig.1: Python code of Exceltool1, Fig.2: Python code of Exceltool1, Here are my contact details:, Email: ajay@blackcoffer.com, Skype: asbidyarthy, WhatsApp: +91 9717367468, Telegram: @asbidyarthy , For project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?

Someone filing FOIA SEC request or FOIA FDA request and/or registering for conference calls might also have posted some negative tweets on tweeter to influence the market. Dashboard should display data of requests, sentiments, stock prices, etc on the same timeline, so that we will be able to observe the changes and relative changes with respect to time. Make separate dashboard for 2 stock symbols to analyse the activities and changes specific to that and a dashboard for all the data, eg. stocks, requests, etc. Change in sentiments effecting the price of the stock, borrow rate, trading volume, etc. should be noticeable. There is a list of names, make alert on the dashboard when the requests are filed by them on the same timeline used for other data. Also include the candlestick chart to view the stock details like open, close, high, low, volume with respect to time. , For FOIA SEC and FDA requests, made a metric chart representing the total number of requests and requesters, created a date histogram to view the frequency of requests and requesters with respect to time, bar chart to view the top requester name, organization, category, pie chart to view the proportion of final disposition of requests and tag cloud for the description of the requests for the entries present in the selected time range and a search table that contains the selected columns (only relevant ones) for both SEC filings and FDA filings., Similarly, for citation data, created a date histogram to view the frequency of citations and names of firms who posted with respect to time and bar chart to view number of citations by firm in the selected time range and a search table that contains the selected columns (only relevant ones). Index containing fail to deliver data is used to plot the date histogram in which volume failed is represented by the bar along the line representing the price at that time, bar chart where bars represents the total volume failed to deliver with respect to stock symbol and average price of the stock symbol in the selected time range by a dot size add on and tag cloud of the stock symbol as per fail to delivers., For twitter data (short seller’s data), made a pie chart to show the proportion of polarity, metric table to show the highest 10 average retweets with respect to user name, made a date histogram to show the frequency of tweets as per time and another date histogram representing the amount of positive and negative sentiments with the help of bars as per time to leverage us to observe if change in amount of sentiments is affecting price of stock, volume in trade and fail to deliver, etc., bar chart to show the total posts and number of posts in the selected time range and another bar chart to show the count of followers and friends in the index in selected time range. A search table is made with columns like polarity, follower counts, retweets and post with timestamp to get precise info of what we have in visualizations., For the list of names to be tracked on requests made and to make alert for them, added a annotation on the TSVB graph and added all of these along with the above visualizations on the dashboard on Kibana to make it a real-time dashboard and we can use this dashboard to do relative analysis., For the dedicated dashboards to the stock, created and added following visualizations:, 3 dashboards- 1 dashboard for complete data and 2 dashboards dedicatedly for one stock each. , Kibana and Elasticsearch, Visualizations and analytical skills were used, Following databases are used to:, AWS Management Console, As I was using Kibana and studying the stock data for the first time, I faced challenges in making complex visualizations and understanding the terms related to stock data.

Parsing of the input XML file.
Predicting the Name, Place and Organization.
Rearranging the XML file to its origin form with the predicted value.
, 
It was not possible by the beautiful soup library. So by using the logically function start index and end index we break the sentence.
For predicting the NPO we used the flair ner-german model.
To rearrange the file we used start index and end index function which can be split with a certain condition and we place the predicted value in it.

Fetching the data from CRM 
Unclean Data
Merging the Data 
, 
To Fetch the data from CRM. We used Zapier. It is connector between two applications so that whenever a particular incident happen it will populate into another application. We use Zapier to connect CRM and Google sheets so that whenever a new lead will change or modified data will be stored into google sheets.
Data in google sheets was uncleaned. First, we connect the Google sheet with PowerbI then perform EDA to clean the data using DAX language.
Using merging of two tables by ONE-ON-ONE schema we solve duplicate entries of a particular lead in PowerBI.

He has setup CRMs for that. He wanted to use CRMs data and want to visualize the leads in PowerBI, First, we check CRMs thoroughly and understand the work culture of his company. It was not easy to fetch data into PowerBI using API key. To fetch new leads from CRMs we used Zapier. The limitation of Zapier is it cannot fetch historical data into spreadsheet. So we download data from CRMs and fetch it into spreadsheet. For new leads we created zaps for every instance. After that we connect the spreadsheet with PowerBI and clean the data accordingly. Using that data, we build KPIs according to client need., API , Zapier , Spreadsheet , PowerBI,  M language , DAX, API , M language , DAX , PowerBI, First challenge was to fetch data from CRMs using API key. Data we were getting was uncleaned and were not able to fetch all data. If there were multiple pages in the CRMs we will not be able to fetch all data from the pages., Technical challenge in this project was to extract data from CRMs. So for that we used Zapier connector from CRMs to spreadsheet. But there was some limitation with Zapier that it will not fetch the historical data of our CRMs. So to solve that we download all historical data from CRMs and append it to the spreadsheet we were using.

He wanted to see all his client appointments at one place. Client took subscription of Monday.com. It is an CRM where you can manage your work more easily in neat and clean user-friendly environment. We can easily track our task on Monday.com. Pipeline for Monday.com is very easy to use and also customized according to our needs., The challenging part of this project was to get CRM data on Monday.com dashboard. Client also has subscription of Zapier. Zapier is a connector which connect two apps to transfer data from each other. Zapier also has limitation to fetch limited type of data from CRM. Like for Mohsin CRM we can only fetch hot lead comes on CRM. But in his CRM there are also other functions like if a customer lead comes on CRM. They manually book appointment for that client. So there is no way to get that data from CRM. Issue for client was he has attached integrated four google calendar account with CRM so whenever he confirms appointment on CRM that data fetched on google calendar. But he has check manually one by one on each calendar which was bit hard task for him. So, we advised Monday.com where he can track all his task at one place., The challenging part of this project was to get CRM data on Monday.com dashboard.There is no direct integration of CRM and Monday.com to fetch data., To solve challenges, we used Zapier to get CRM data to dashboard of Monday.com. We used google calendar of client which were integrated with CRM. All the appointment confirmed leads were present on google calendar.Pipeline of Data:,   CRM 🡪 Google Calendar 🡪 Zapier 🡪 Monday.com, Using the Monday.com dashboard client can easily track all appointments of customers. He can track data of his team members and connect with them at one place. He will not miss any of his meeting with customer.

The accuracy for the bug free code on the models used by the client was shaen once the model ran on a different set of data input
, 
A vanilla code to execute the same logic while fine tuning the matching algorithm was written in order to over come the shortcomings of the pretrained model bugs
The data pre-processing was done manually in order to transform every instance of an input into better readable format to be able to go into the model and get best matching accuracy possible in the given timeframe of execution of the code 
, 
Helped the client to perform the matching process with maximum accuracy and lowest cost on code, by implementing manually written vanilla code from scratch to utilise the matching algorithm.

Extract funding-related data from news articles (from 1000+ websites) such as company name, funded amount, participated investors, and other details. 
create a web app to manage the extraction of funding  data
, 
There were 1000+ websites from funding-related articles so we couldn’t make a crawler for each website. So we used an inbuilt web crawler provided by elasticsearch. When we have extracted articles then we need to extract funding related information company name, fund amount and investors participated etc. Then we decided to use NLP’s question-answering method in which we need to train transformers to extract funding-related information. First we have created some keywords based approaches to create labels for each field we need to extract to train models. After that we have trained distil bert model on labelled data on AWS EC2’s GPU server. We applied this approach for all the fields we need to extract. We got 90%+ accuracy for the company name field and for other fields we got 80%+ accuracy.
To manage and view all the fields of extracted funding data we created a web app using python flask. In this we created several pages to show extracted raw data by crawler,  cleaned data after applying some cleaning functions and final output which have all the fields.  We also created admin dashboard pages to show daily crawling status, how many articles processed in one day, total final output etc.

The client wanted to extract data from 1000+ different websites and if we make any crawler it only works for one website so it was not possible to create a 1000+ web crawler.
How to extract funding information from an article. It is very difficult to extract that type of information from normal python code by defining keywords because every website has different types of articles.
, 
To solve web crawler-related issues we used elasticsearch web crawler which is very fast and can extract multiple websites at a time. In this we need to create an engine and add websites that we want to scrape. After that we added some keywords to extract only funding-related articles. We set up this crawler to run every hour so we can get new articles every hour.
To extract funding-related information we collected articles from different websites and created labels for each field we wanted to extract. After that we have fine-tuned the transformer’s Distil-bert model on our labeled data.  We used these models to extract funding-related information. We also created an automated python script that uses these model on every extracted article and extracts funding-related information.

When we checked call details in the zendesk api, the details were in json format which is very tough to understand the calls details. So first we have fetched only needed details (call made from person, to person and call timing) converted into tabular format. In tabular format it was easy to identify call details., After that we need to identify the number of calls made by the user to the company in the last month.  We used the python pandas module here which is very fast and effective to handle tabular data. First we separated the user who made a call to the company last month and then counted each unique user’s call records.

Fetch all call logs using zendesk api from drivelah server
Analyse call logs and  number of calls made by a particular phone number to company and fetch recent call timing  
, 
for fetching call details and converting into table format
for identifying number of calls made and recent call timing 
, 
First one was the api data in json format with other unwanted data so it was a little difficult for us to identify the number of calls and other information from direct json data.
The date format in the api data is not appropriate for us  to handle. Because the date is  stored in string format, it was difficult to compare dates with one another and identify recent ones.
, 
For the first technical challenge we first took only useful details from api’s json format and converted these details in tabular format. In python we can easily handle tables with pandas dataframe and can apply whatever operation we want to collect details.
For the second one we know that it would be difficult to handle dates in string format. So we first converted dates to a proper datetime format using python’s datetime module. It has a lot of built in functionalities which can easily compare dates with one another.  So from comparison we have identified recent dates of calls.

Build ML/AI Model to predict next 15 min EMA cross on historical and live data by using indicators such as EMA, MACD, RSI etc.
Create a web app to show predicted EMA cross and other indicators movement
, 
In stock market indicators such as EMA, MACD, RSI etc helps us to find cross by using historical price data. If we accurately predict cross earlier then it will help us in investment. So we have used 12data api to collect historical and live EUR/USD price data. We calculated EMA(12), EMA(26), MACD and RSI indicators based on price data.  After that we created labels of ema cross in historical data. When we have training data we used different classifier models for training. We predicted accuracy  with different models and the Logistic regression model gave 91% accuracy. This logistic regression is predicting the cross only for the next step. It means we will know only 15 minutes before that the cross will happen in the next 15 min but we need to know more earlier. For that we predicted the next 45 minutes price values using the LSTM model from historical price data. Based on these price values we have calculated EMA, MACD and RSI and  after that cross using logistic regression. So now we can predict the cross 1 hour earlier based on these 2 models.
To show cross and other  indicators movement we created a python flask web app and hosted it on AWS EC2 server. The process runs every 15 minutes  and checks the cross. If there is any cross in 1 hour it sends a telegram notification.
, 
Flask web app
All the python code and machine learning models
, 
Main challenge in this project is to find the best model. Because we have time series data so we cannot change the orders to get better accuracy.
One machine learning model is only predicting the next 15 min cross but we need the ema cross 1 hour before.
, 
We were using time series data so we cannot change the order to find better accuracy in every model.  So we have tried different models with the same order and evaluated the model. Only the logistic regression model worked best for the data it gave 91% accuracy on test data.
To get the next 1 hour prediction we first tried the same logistic regression to predict the next 3 steps but we failed because of poor accuracy. So we trained the LSTM model on price data and predicted the next 3 steps using the LSTM model.  After that we used logistic regression to predict ema cross.

For eg: we have Person nodes in the data, now people might enter their names in different ways. Our main aim is to identify Person nodes that may have similar data and are actually the same person. This will be represented as a perfect match between the nodes. This single-person view is referred to as the Golden Record, Till date, we have loaded data into Neo4j and created relationships with score property which defines match strength. We have created some criterias by which we can determine what constitutes two nodes being the same and then based on them created ‘perfect match’ and ‘probable match’.We have considered four properties for our criteria – full name, address, driver’s license, and passport number. We have relationships between nodes for these properties with scores, we use these in our perfect match and probable match creation., We have also configured Graphlytics (a viz software) in the virtual machine which connects to the neo4j database and helps vizualize the nodes and relationships. , We have also worked on some algorithms using the GDS library in neo4j to produce more information on the graph, the common neighbors algorithm was used to produce scores based on node similarity and the higher the score the higher the similarity. Other algorithms were tried as well but since all the properties are of String format it did not work on it., We have Resolved issues neo4j is facing when deleting a Large set of data and Provided steps to recover neo4j if it fails by going OutofMemory., We have figured out the issues with the probable and perfect match cypher queries not working as intended and proposed a solution. , Neo4j, Cypher Query Language, The common neighbors algorithm, CQL, Neo4j, Here are my contact details:, Email: ajay@blackcoffer.com, Skype: asbidyarthy, WhatsApp: +91 9717367468, Telegram: @asbidyarthy , For project discussions and daily updates, would you like to use Slack, Skype, Telegram, or Whatsapp?

This application uses AI to decide what action to take while trading., Our Solution, We have integrated coin_api with the application from which data is extracted. We have created the homepage for this application. We have changed the code structure of the front end to make it more fast and efficient., Solution Architecture, An application, where the first automated top asset pair selection happens. If the coins are co-integrated, then only one indicator must be executed else trading starts based on 2 indicators., The AI agent will take specific action to trade based on the algorithm., Deliverables, We have removed the old API and integrated the new api with the application., We have altered the code structure of the front end to make the code faster and more efficient., Tools used, Visual studio code, Language/techniques used, Python, Skills used, Django, Databases used, SQlite, Web Cloud Servers used, Digital Ocean, What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution, We faced an issue while integrating coin api with the application while retrieving the data. To retrieve the data using the coin api, we need to input a symbol id. This symbol id is a combination of exchange_name, symbol_type, currency_we_want_to_trade, and quote_currency. There are N coins that can be retrieved using coin api. There are more than multiple exchanges, multiple symbol types, and multiple quote currencies for ONE SINGLE COIN. This makes there is a huge no. Of combinations for one single coin. This made the execution of the api integration very slow., How the Technical Challenges were Solved, We created one drop-down for exchange selection, one drop-down for symbol type selection, one drop for coin, and one drop-down for quote currency selection.

The client’s ads were spread across multiple revenue generating platforms, including Google Adsense, Adx, and Ezoic, while the spending was managed through the Google Ads Platform. At that time, the client lacked a centralized dashboard or website that could effectively calculate ROAS by integrating revenue and cost streams. This fragmentation made it challenging for the client to track and evaluate the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. Therefore, a comprehensive solution was developed and implemented, providing a centralized platform for calculating ROAS, aligning revenue and cost data from various sources, and enabling informed decision-making regarding advertising investments. , We developed a comprehensive solution to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) and centralizing their advertising data. The solution involved collecting data from four different APIs: Google Ads API for spending data, Google Adsense API, Ad Manager API, and Ezoic data for revenue data. To ensure compatibility, we utilized an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tool to convert the data received from each API, which was in different formats, into a standardized format storing them Pandas Dataframe for both revenue and spending data., The transformed data was then stored in a Postgres database for easy access and management. To automate the data extraction process, we implemented an ETL script that runs twice daily via cronjob on a Digital Ocean VM, ensuring the latest data is always available., Moreover, we designed a backend API using the Flask framework. This API fetched the required data from the Postgres DB, allowing users to retrieve relevant information efficiently., Finally, we implemented a ROAS Dashboard frontend to display the calculated ROAS using the fetched values. The dashboard provided a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to track and monitor their advertising performance. With our solution in place, the client could now easily monitor ROAS over time, access consolidated data, and make informed decisions regarding their advertising investments., The solution architecture involved a multi-step process to address the challenges faced by the client in calculating ROAS and centralizing their advertising data. Data was collected from various APIs, including Google Ads API, Google Adsense API, Ad Manager API, and Ezoic data, and transformed into a standardized format using an ETL tool. , The transformed data was stored in a Postgres database, and a backend API was developed using the Flask framework to fetch the required data. The calculated ROAS was then displayed on a Next Js Dashboard, providing users with an intuitive interface to track and analyze their advertising performance., Python 3.9, Flask API, DigitalOcean Droplet, Functional Programming in Python, ETL Tool, Python, Git, Deployment, Data Engineering, Web Development using Next js, We used PostgreSQL database for the project., Digital Ocean Droplet, Some of the technical challenges encountered were:, 1. Ensuring data integrity: Implemented checks, cleansing, and validation to maintain the accuracy and reliability of the data., 2. Docker image deployment on VM: Configured VM to support Docker Image for ETL and deployed the image for seamless execution., 3. Setting up automated ETL pipeline: Automated data extraction, transformation, and loading processes for efficient data management via cronjob., 4. Adding SSL certificate to backend API: Secured backend API with SSL certificate, enabling encrypted communication for enhanced data protection., The implemented solution had a significant positive impact on the client’s business. By providing a centralized platform for calculating ROAS and integrating data from multiple revenue-generating platforms, the client gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. The availability of real-time, consolidated data enabled informed decision-making regarding advertising investments. The user-friendly interface of the RAOS Dashboard allowed the client to easily track and monitor their advertising performance, leading to improved campaign optimization and potentially higher returns on advertising spend. Overall, the solution streamlined the client’s advertising operations, resulting in increased efficiency and improved business outcomes., Here are the project snapshots:, https://roasing.com/, We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise., Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com, © All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

In addition to this, all of the backend javascript also needed to be changed in order to query the new elasticsearch database., The client’s website was a visualization tool. It also had GUI to add filters. To make the visualizations, at least 50,000 records needed to be pulled from the Postgres database whose size would be around 200mbs. This would take a lot of time (nearly 20-30 secs). Adding filters would take additional time. So our task was to move the entire database over to Elasticsearch from postgres since it is way more faster in search operations and also filtering data. Since the database was changed, we also had to write new backend code that would now query the Elasticsearch database., Elasticsearch, Postman, Kibana, Logstash, Python, Javascript, Amazon Web Services, Postgres, Docker, Git Bucket, Github, Javascript, Json, Domain-Specific Language for elasticsearch, bash, Elasticsearch query knowledge, Postgres query knowledge, Networking, Javascript, Backend web stack, Postgres, Elasticsearch, Amazon Web Services (AWS), To solve the above mentioned problem, we used gzip in the request url’s header. This significantly reduced the execution times., Earlier postgres infrastructure which took around 20-30 secs now too consistently less than 10 secs to perform filter and search operations. This would contribute to a better user experience., We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise., Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com, © All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

The importance of digital analytics is that it allows for a data-driven approach to marketing, and as such it can produce better results., The primary objective of the project is to help the businesses in knowing their target audience, understanding the trends in digital marketing, and providing insights on the analytics part of their website performance. Use the digital analytical data to determine if your business’ aims are in line with the customer’s wants and needs. As the picture of the customer’s needs unfolds, adjust the objectives accordingly.  , The main aim of this project is to assist the businesses to improve their website performance with the use of technologies like Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager and dashboards built on Whatagraph. , Google Analytics: , Google Analytics is integral to tracking and measuring data from a number of digital platforms, but especially web metrics and customer behaviour. For example, through Google Analytics, you can see when people drop out of the buying process, perhaps they abandon while on the cart page, which would then inform your decisions on how to improve the check-out process., Because Google Analytics measures traffic from a variety of devices and sources and integrates with other online platforms, such as Google Ads, it is a handy tool to get an overview of your business’s digital analytics., Google Tag Manager:, Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments collectively known as tags on your website or mobile app. Once the small segment of Tag Manager code has been added to your project, you can safely and easily deploy analytics and measurement tag configurations from a web-based user interface., When Tag Manager is installed, your website or app will be able to communicate with the Tag Manager servers. You can then use Tag Manager’s web-based user interface to set up tags, establish triggers that cause your tag to fire when certain events occur, and create variables that can be used to simplify and automate your tag configurations.A Tag Manager container can replace all other manually-coded tags on a site or app, including tags from Google Ads, Google Analytics, Floodlight, and 3rd party tags. , Whatagraph Dashboards: , The whatgraph dashboards previews the important metrics related to the website including conversions, events, number of users and performance about ads and campaigns by the website. This dashboard helps in drawing some of the useful insights for the website notifying the strengths,gains and areas of improvement. , Main deliverables for the project are: , The main technical challenge faced was that any changes in Google Analytics are operational after 24 hrs. Thus, we can’t judge if the setup works as per required. , We had to wait for 24 hours to check the setup. We could use real-time report as well to check the setup on-the spot. , This analysis helps to improve website performance, understanding user behavior, understanding the impact of business campaigns and improvising the UI/UX to increase their potential users. , Having insight into your clients’ behaviour and demographics can help you make decisions about serving them the right products at the right time for maximum chances of a sale. Such data could include a client’s persona, such as their age, location, and areas of interest., Some of the common metrics that are important in digital analytics include:, Dashboard metrics:, Some examples are pages per visit, bounce rate, and average duration of each visit., Most exited pages:, Pages with an exit rate of 75–100% show that you need to examine the problem with the content and improve upon it., Most visited pages:, These pages will make the customers either exit or explore the website further., Referring websites:, These are other websites that link to your website., Conversion rate:, This indicates whether the goal of your website was achieved, be it a sale of a product, a free giveaway, or a subscription to a newsletter., Frequency of visitors:, This tells you about the loyalty of the customers., Days to the last transaction:, This refers to the time lapse between the first visit and the sale. The shorter the time taken, the better it is for your business., Figure 1: Google Tag Manager Domains, Figure 2: Google Tags , Figure  3: Google Analytics , Figure 4: Google Analytics, Figure 5: Tracking Facebook Pixels for a website, Figure 6: Whatagraph dashboard, Figure 7: Whatagraph Dashboard(Conversions) , , We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise., Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com, © All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

It had one main website and three other sub websites to analyse the button clicks, impressions and understanding the user’s behaviour on the website. Many events were to be tracked and converted to a dashboard in Google Data Studio to make it simpler to understand. , This project was created to give this data in a way that companies can readily understand through the use of visualisations. The graphs will show the increase/decrease in any of the metrics, as well as the manner in which the increase/decrease occurs. It will display all of the crucial data monthly or even by date range to help you keep track of the changes that occur., The main aim of this project is to display the event flow, user flow and behaviour flow through dashboards and analyse them to work on the areas of improvements. , Google Analytics: , Google Analytics is integral to tracking and measuring data from a number of digital platforms, but especially web metrics and customer behaviour. For example, through Google Analytics, you can see when people drop out of the buying process, perhaps they abandon while on the cart page, which would then inform your decisions on how to improve the check-out process., Because Google Analytics measures traffic from a variety of devices and sources and integrates with other online platforms, such as Google Ads, it is a handy tool to get an overview of your business’s digital analytics., Google Tag Manager:, Google Tag Manager is a tag management system (TMS) that allows you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments collectively known as tags on your website or mobile app. Once the small segment of Tag Manager code has been added to your project, you can safely and easily deploy analytics and measurement tag configurations from a web-based user interface., When Tag Manager is installed, your website or app will be able to communicate with the Tag Manager servers.

There were three sub websites for which there were two types of views each. Each of the views had several buttons related to the product. The project was about finding the user flow and event flow on the views., The main technical challenge faced was that there were multiple events setup in Google Analytics for one event and thus identifying a particular one was difficult. , We had to communicate with the client to clarify about the event names. Although this took some time but it was necessary since accurateness of data is very essential for the project., This analysis helps to improve website performance, understanding user behavior, understanding the impact of business campaigns and improvising the UI/UX to increase their potential users. , Having insight into your clients’ behaviour and demographics can help you make decisions about serving them the right products at the right time for maximum chances of a sale. Such data could include a client’s persona, such as their age, location, and areas of interest., Some of the common metrics that are important in digital analytics include:, Dashboard metrics:, Some examples are pages per visit, bounce rate, and average duration of each visit., Conversion rate:, This indicates whether the goal of your website was achieved, be it a sale of a product, a free giveaway, or a subscription to a newsletter., Source/Medium Analysis: , This analysis helps in understanding the traffic sources and medium on the website. This helps the businesses to work on strengthening the traffic sources to get better reach to the target audience., Traffic Analysis: , The overall traffic analysis for the website provides information regarding the important metrics like users,avg. session duration and goal completions according to different source/medium. This will help the  business to analyse different traffic channels performances., Figure 1: Tracking of Buttons for Triber Virtual Studio, Figure 2: Triber Goal Conversions, Figure 3: Kiger 360 Experience Website Tracking, ,     Figure 4: Traffic Medium Analysis, Figure 5: Overview of Dashboard Metrics, Figure 6: Kiger Studio Experience Website, Website URL: , https://www.renault.co.in/, Dashboard URL: , We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise., Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com, © All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

We can then pay you weekly to keep them up to date. You can choose any technology you like, as long as it’s updated into an SQL database. Additional tasks may be to make an alert or dashboard from data, later access API when it becomes available., We provided a robust solution which returned the NFT data every 8 hours into the google big query database. To do this we used selenium web driver to scrape all events as the website was dynamic and did not have a format data structure to scrape data using AJAX POST calls. After automating the scarper the data was manipulated and constructed into a desired format into pandas dataframe, which was later used to push the dataframe into the google big query database using Google cloud api and credentials. The data was getting collected every day and about 50M distinct rows were created., SQL , Google BigQuery, Google BigQuery, The only technical challenge faced during this project was that the website used to keep changing the elements on their webpage and used to cause error. Though it did not use to happen regularly, it happened 3 times in 5 weeks. Also AJAX calls were not proper., Identifying the elements solved the issue. Also remote access to a better desktop enabled me to keep working as well as keep the code running all the time., We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise., Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com, © All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

These enhancements may be implemented if companies obtain current data about their leads and analyse it in order to take appropriate actions in the future., This project was created to give this data in a way that companies can readily understand through the use of visualisations. The graphs will show the increase/decrease in any of the metrics, as well as the manner in which the increase/decrease occurs. It will display all of the crucial data monthly or even by date range to help you keep track of the changes that occur., The solution for the project includes data insights through visualisations which will help businesses to better analyse the available data. This solution will help the businesses in improvising the factors to increase their potential customers and raise their respective ranks. , It is divided into two parts: databases and data dashboard. The databases will store the important data retrieved from the LSA dashboard and use them to calculate some important metrics. The data dashboard will represent those metrics in form of graphs and data in form of tables. , The project deliverables can be divided into two parts: , For extracting the data from the LSA Dashboard, we have made our own tool by python scripts. The automation tool will store data in the excel sheets and google bigquery for respective businesses on a day to day basis. PyCharm for compiling and running the code. JsonViewer for processing , We have used the LSA API to extract data from the LSA Dashboard. Google Sheets API to store data in excel sheets. Bigquery API for storing data in google bigquery. The scripts for the automation tool were written in the Python programming language. , Software Model: RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model, In the RAD paradigm, less emphasis is placed on planning and more emphasis is placed on development activities. It aims to create software in a short period of time., Advantages of RAD Model: , Two types of databases: Google excel sheets and google bigquery. , Google BigQuery Cloud Database with up to 1 TB of free storage is being used., Some minor technical challenges were faced for clients with minimum data. For those, plotting graphs became difficult. , We tried to process the data, remove the blank data spaces and plotted the graph with available data. , It’s undeniable that Google’s Local Services ads (LSA) have changed the way home service businesses advertise online., The pay per lead system designed to provide the end-user with a quick, clean and trusted experience, gives small and medium-sized businesses a better shot at competing with national brands and massive budget operations., To win with the Local Services the businesses need to take care of some factors where data comes to help. , Fig.1: Data Dashboard for individual businesses-1, Fig.2: Data Dashboard for individual businesses-2, Fig.3: Consolidated Dashboard, Fig.4: Historical Account Data, Fig.5: CPA and CPL datasheet, Fig.6: Lead Dispute Status, We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise., Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com, © All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

Using these three data, we calculate and store other important metrics like Cost per Acquisition, Conversion Rate, number of booked leads, number disputed leads, pending leads and approved leads. Google data studio dashboard: The dashboard will show the count of important metrics like total number of records, total interactions and different types of leads. It will represent different types of graphs portraying different kinds of information and tables containing major data like Lead data combined and Net monthly spent on Ads. , Dialling in your service area, Profile and Budget: The data from the message and phone leads help to know whether they are potential customers. If they are potential customers, their location and profile can help you in charging them or not charging the leads. Mark your JOBS as Booked: The dashboard will display the number of archived leads and booked leads. This count can help you analyse your performance and how you can work to increase your potential customers. Deal with disputes: The dashboard will also represent the disputed disputes and approved disputes which will help you to deal with the disputes. Net Monthly Ad Spend: This is an important metric which helps the firms to make better decisions for their expenditure. They can have an efficient control over their expenditure once they have proper data available. Other metrics related to finances include Cost per lead, Cost per Acquisition and Conversion rate. ][Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain, AI Bot Audio to audio, Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development, Healthcare Data Dashboard in Kibana, Understanding the Millennial Market, Google LSA Ads (Google Local Service Ads) – ETL tools and..., Lipsync Automation for Celebrities and Influencers, Google LSA API Data Automation and Dashboarding, Transforming the Healthcare Systems, Turn Your Website Analytics into Actionable Insights &amp; Decisions Using Neo4J..., Online Barometer Dashboard for Smart Schools System, Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain, AI Bot Audio to audio, Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development, Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain, AI Bot Audio to audio, Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development, ABOUT US, FOLLOW US][AWS Lex Voice and Chatbot - Blackcoffer Insights][Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain, Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development, Streamlined Integration: Interactive Brokers API with Python for Desktop Trading Application, Efficient Data Integration and User-Friendly Interface Development: Navigating Challenges in Web Application Deployment, AI Bot Audio to audio, Methodology for ETL Discovery Tool using LLMA, OpenAI, Langchain, Methodology for database discovery tool using openai, LLMA, Langchain, Chatbot using VoiceFlow, Rising IT cities and its impact on the economy, environment, infrastructure, and city life by the year 2040., Rising IT Cities and Their Impact on the Economy, Environment, Infrastructure, and City Life in Future, Internet Demand’s Evolution, Communication Impact, and 2035’s Alternative Pathways, Rise of Cybercrime and its Effect in upcoming Future, AI/ML and Predictive Modeling, Solution for Contact Centre Problems, How to Setup Custom Domain for Google App Engine Application?, Code Review Checklist, Client: A leading tech firm in USA, Industry Type:  IT, Services: eCommerce, Organization Size: 40+, Create a Voice and chatbot using AWS lex which can book flights, hotels, cars and book some fun activities in a city., We need to create a voice and chatbot using AWS lex and lambda function. The bot should book a flight, a hotel, and a car by asking some relevant questions to the user like destination, origin, date, etc. We also need to create a combination of all these which can plan the whole trip, flight, hotel, car and book some fun activities. , We have created aws lex intents and lambda functions for all bookings. Intents manage front ends like utterances (user can ask to the bot) and slots (bot replies with relevant questions). Lambda functions manage backend parts like which intent should be triggered if the user says “ book a flight” or “book a hotel” or “book a car”. For search results we have used some external APIs like Amadeus for flight, sabre for hotels and blablacar for car booking.  We have modified search results by using Data Analytics (for getting the cheapest and good star flight and hotel), Machine learning (for getting user’s preferences by analyzing user’s history) and NLP (Differentiate search results by text analysis) techniques so users can get the best search results. , An aws lex voice and chatbot which can book flight, hotel, car and fun activities. This can be integrated with IOS applications. , AWS Lex, AWS Lambda, AWS Cognito, AWS EC2, Google colab, VS code, FAST API, Uvicorn., python, machine learning, data analytics, NLP., TfIdf-Vectorizer and cosine similarity, Data Analytics, Machine learning, NLP, Python, AWS, REST APIs., MySQL, AWS, We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise., Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com, © All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

Because lex uses some intentes to show responses from the lambda function. So we have created different lex intents to pass messages to lex bot from lambda function. And put some good coding to the lambda function so different messages can be handled by different intents.For flight, hotel and car search results we were using some external apis like amadeus, sabre and blablacars apis. These APIs have a lot of data and are not in a format we need.  So first we cleaned data and then sorted data according to cheaper and best ratings results. We have used the best two results among all the results. We cannot use all the machine learning and data analytics part in aws lambda function. So what we did was we created some REST APIs which can handle all the data analytics and machine learning part and we hosted these APIs on AWS EC2 instance. We used these APIs in our lambda functions.So Creating a button in a chat bot or voice bot is always so different from providing text messages. For creating a button we used a response card structure in lambda function which can handle button and button related responses.][Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain, AI Bot Audio to audio, Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development, Data science – Create Tailored algorithms, Should people wear fabric gloves?

So, to search for the important data specifically related to Canada only, with a lot of keywords was a challenging part for us.Then, if we somehow manage to do the task by automating it upto some extent only, we are required to find the dates of the articles, news, think tanks, documents etc, that was also a challenging part.While working on Phase 2, we need to scrape the data from the URLs, so sometimes, the news articles were removed from the website, which we earlier took in our datasets which cause problems in extracting the data.Then cleaning the webpages was also challenge for us, because this project is for research, so data is important to us. So, it was difficult to take only that data from website which we require and are most important., We used sitemaps of websites to find different articles that we require according to the keywords, manual research was done to find out which URL will solve the purpose. Manual checking of results of automation tools, that we created, was done.To find the dates of the articles, we wrote multiple regular expressions, that will find the match for the dates that we need, also manual checking was done after that.To scrape removed webpages, we used WayBack machine or google archives, which stores all the deleted webpages.To clean the data, we filtered out various HTML tags, classes, ids by using regex, manual research.][Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain, AI Bot Audio to audio, Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development, Qualtrics API integration using Python, Negative effects of marketing on society, Data Harmonization, ETL, Data Cleansing, &amp; Classifications, IoT &amp; AI/ML Solution for Gas Stations, Design and develop retool app for wholecell.io and Asana data using..., Integration of Python and Power BI, Python as an External Tool..., What is the limitation of e-learning classes?, AI and NLP-based Solutions to Automate Data Discovery for Venture Capital..., Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain, AI Bot Audio to audio, Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development, Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain, AI Bot Audio to audio, Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development, ABOUT US, FOLLOW US][Lipsync Automation for Celebrities and Influencers - Blackcoffer Insights][Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain, Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development, Streamlined Integration: Interactive Brokers API with Python for Desktop Trading Application, Efficient Data Integration and User-Friendly Interface Development: Navigating Challenges in Web Application Deployment, AI Bot Audio to audio, Methodology for ETL Discovery Tool using LLMA, OpenAI, Langchain, Methodology for database discovery tool using openai, LLMA, Langchain, Chatbot using VoiceFlow, Rising IT cities and its impact on the economy, environment, infrastructure, and city life by the year 2040., Rising IT Cities and Their Impact on the Economy, Environment, Infrastructure, and City Life in Future, Internet Demand’s Evolution, Communication Impact, and 2035’s Alternative Pathways, Rise of Cybercrime and its Effect in upcoming Future, AI/ML and Predictive Modeling, Solution for Contact Centre Problems, How to Setup Custom Domain for Google App Engine Application?, Code Review Checklist, Client: A leading tech firm in India, Industry Type:  Entertainment, Services: B2C, Organization Size: 100+, To change the lipsing of the original video with the new replaced audio., We needed to create an output video that will have the new lipsing according to the new replaced audio.

Training, Organization Size: 1000+, It is a culture management platform that uses learning as the fundamental mode of communication. The platform requires an Analytics portion that captures a variety of data related to the interaction of the learner with content, assessments, engagements and forums to create personalized learning plans for each user to increase the effectiveness of learning and its retention which together make an impact on the overall productivity of the learner and the organization., We helped the client in deciding the data required for the analysis process. We came up with the appropriate models for various tasks and interpretations of how the data will be collected and analysed for the initial response, final response, retention, proficiency, and learning intent of the user. We designed the models in such a way that one can perform seamlessly grading for each question type (based on difficulty level) and at a different hierarchical level (sub-section, section, training, and so on). We knew that each user has its unique aptitude level (basic, intermediate, and advanced) and keeping that in my mind, we incorporated those aptitude levels in our analytics too. Moreover, we integrated the grade and time factor into the analysis so that more points are allotted for comparatively tough questions and quick responses, respectively., MS Excel sheet, Google spreadsheets with proper tables and visualizations. , Jupyter notebook, MS Excel, Google Spreadsheets. , Python., Data science and analytics., Generated our data through data simulation., Data analytics is all about analysing and finding patterns in the data that already exist or are getting generated in real-time. However, this project is in the budding stage, and we had no data to start our analysis. Moreover, this project is novel, and the dataset that meets our requirements was nearly impossible to find online. , We performed data simulation techniques and tried to generate the data as authentic as possible using some libraries in python and random functions in spreadsheets.

The file has nested JSON data within it’s attributes so abstracts data from the nested columns into a new dataframe. Completed handling complex nested json formed columns abstracted from nested json. Then need to Handle the missing data by mapping it with another index dataset further missing values for certain attributes were handled by mean value and 0 substitution. This task involves numerous pandas operations along with multiple python functions. Further done Exploratory Data Analysis on the cleaned dataset finding correlation matrix and plotting certain seaborn graphs between strong correlated attributes., Worked on Accessing Json Data, done tree Analysis on Json Sample data., Both the File was too big for reading and applying some Python Code in JupyterNb, so performed chunking of stocktwits_legacy_messages_2015_10.txt  with chunk size = 20000 rows at a time. Similarly trying for the other file., Created a list of all the chunked files of Json Data &amp; Concat all the files in that list., The File has Nested Json data within it’s attributes so abstracted data from the nested columns into a new DataFrame. Completed handling complex nested json formed columns abstracted from nested json., Renamed the columns with identification. (Eg: ‘id’ as ‘entities_id’) likewise for others. So that while merging the data doesn’t create any issue. Completed forming Preprocessed csv file for 1st json file which  Output2015.csv., For Second file size was &gt; 3gb so splitted the file into ten parts and then individually solved nested json for all these parts like done in the 1st file finally concat them into one, then handled columns arrangements and removed unwanted columns and finally removed dictionary representation from entity_sentiments column. Completed forming Preprocessed csv file for 2nd json file which is Output_Stocktwits_2017.csv., The cleaned dataset finding correlation matrix and plotting certain seaborn graphs between strong correlated attributes.

In the RAD model, there is less attention paid to the planning and more priority is given to the development tasks. It targets developing software in a short span of time., ● Advantages of RAD Model:, o Changing requirements can be accommodated., o Progress can be measured., o Iteration time can be short with the use of powerful RAD tools., o Productivity with fewer people in a short time., o Reduced development time., o Increases reusability of components., o Quick initial reviews occur., o Encourages customer feedback., o Integration from the very beginning solves a lot of integration issues, ● API Data Abstraction, ● Data Mining and Statistical Modelling, ● Data Wrangling, ● Deployment for Automation, ● Data Visualization, ● SQL, ● Machine Learning, ● Python Programming including OOPs and Exception Handling, ● Google Firestore (Just for Testing Purpose), ● Google BigQuery, Google BigQuery Cloud Database with up to 1 TB of free storage is being used. , ● Scheduling Automation of Python Script., ● Data Exceptions and Duplication in BigQuery Tables., ● Refresh token Expiration After 7 Days., ● Data Exception due to Inactive companies or not Updation of LSA Main sheet. , ● Basecamp ProjectId Issue for transferring Data to multiple companies projects., ● Data Studio Time Series Plot data mismatch due to multiple account id., ● Scheduling Automation of Python Script., Python Library BlockingScheduler were used and the Timezone variable ‘TZ’ was set to Los Angeles in Heroku, ● Data Exceptions and Duplication in BigQuery Tables.,        Structuring SQL Query to deal with all the database issues which were being used in BigQuery to solve those issues., ● Refresh token Expiration after 7 Days., Initially ‘Auth Playground’ was used for generating Refresh token which was getting expired after every 7 Days so to last it longer for more than a year we are now using the refresh token which was generated using Python script where proper token endpoints and many other headers were defined before generating the refresh token., ● Data Exception due to Inactive companies or not Updation of LSA Main sheet. , Data Exception occurred while API data abstraction for few of the companies which were solved by adding more nested try and except statements after understanding issues also ‘LSA Clients Lead’ main sheet was not being updated by other members due to which we missed out data for few of the companies which were solved by creating script which will automatically update the mainsheet when an error occurred., ● Basecamp ProjectId Issue for transferring Data to multiple companies projects., This issue was solved by creating Basecamp Main sheet where data was fetched now by mapping the account id of fetched data using LSA Main sheet and project id of all the basecamp companies., ● Data Studio Time Series Plot data mismatch due to multiple account id., Solved by adding many parameters like setting the metrics which will do a summation of all the companies on a particular day for all the account id., , We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise., Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com, © All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.

And from this pattern, we get some ranges that help us to give early warnings., We are more interested in non-survivor patients’ vital signs as compare to survivor patients. we find patterns in vital signs that could better determine that patient died (ex. if Sp02 is below 70, patient in 95% of cases died, if Sp02 is below 50%, the death rate is 99.9%) or we can take correlations which can help us to find better patterns to define death cases., Data The dataset which was used for analysis here is taken from the mimic website. But the dataset is not in the correct format which we want, after some manipulation, we get the data ready for the analysis., Approach, I can’t go with 1st option because a major part of the data has missing values. so, I decided to go with the second option and fill missing values with the average of upper and lower values. But before that, I filtered the data and take only those patients’ data who died in a hospital or survive., SQL, MongoDB, Google Cloud, https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mo7i32BoEVb0Ac6_CWwJd7_HVbliktx0?usp=sharing, We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise., Contact us: hello@blackcoffer.com, © All Right Reserved, Blackcoffer(OPC) Pvt.
